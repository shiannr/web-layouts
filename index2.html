          Adolf Hitler was born on the 20th of April 1889 in a quaint city in Austria. He was never an exceptional student during his schooling, however he always had a dream of becoming an artist. Unfortunately for him, the one art school he applied to in Vienna rejected him and this lead to a downward spiral in his life. Hitler soon came to the realization that politics can be his savior, intrigued in how the masses respond to certain ideas.
           Shortly after fighting in World War 1 for the German army, he began his political journey by joining the German Worker's party, which inherently was an anti-Semitic, nationalist group.
           Whilst in this party, he began delivering speeches with ideas he disagreed on, and slowly he started to notice that people responded to his speeches with hysteria and willingness to do whatever he would say.
           This power trip is what gave him the confidence he needed, and by 1921 he was the leader of National Socialist German Worker's Party, widely known as the Nazi party.
           Eventually the Second World War began, and Hitler and the Nazi party invaded many European countries, targeting the Jewish people and sending them to "death camps."
           During his sad yet powerful life, Hitler's army killed nearly six million Jews as well as other prisoners of war.
           When nearing defeat, Hitler committed suicide on the 30th of April 1945. His cowardly death and the aftermath of his decisions will forever live on, and he will notoriously be remembered as one of the most evil human beings to have walked on this earth.
